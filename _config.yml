  Welcome to my portfolio!
  <br><br>
  I am heading into my senior year at Arizona State University, double majoring in Data Analytics and Sports Business through the W.P. Carey School of Business. I currently work as a Lead Tutor through University Academic Success Programs at ASU, where I tutor students in math, computer info systems, analytics, economics, finance, and many other subjects. I am also in the job hunt looking for part-time internship opportunities, as well as full-time opportunities that I could begin after graduation in May 2021!
